##Note

* `Suggestion` lists several of my own opinions.

##Question 1
####Level
6/10
Frankly speaking, it is a pretty good paragraph, well done. But need improvement.
####Suggestion
* Please try to remember better word combinations. such as `Wedding Ceremony` instead of `Wedding Event`, `Exciting Event` instead of `Beautiful Event`
* Didnt have a good ending.

##Question 2
####Level
6/10
####Suggestion
* the logic didnt match well, you want to prove `parent is more important than friend`, but you give the reason that `parent induce you to have physical exercise`, you at lease append a sentence like, `thanks for my parents' advice that today I have a good and strong body, and illness hardly can find me`

##Question 3
####Level
7/10
####Suggestion
This speaking paragraph is clear and good but need a necessary well-defined ending.

##Question 4
####Level
6/10
####Suggestion
* I guess you were talking about `scene`, the quality of the recording cant provide me with clear listening, you are talking about `scene`, the recording material gives me sense for this word like `scee`, so please give longer pronunciation of this word and pay attention to the `n` letter in the word.

##Question 5
####Level
8/10
####Suggestion
* Very clear and well done job !
* Pay attention to the ending. The recording one always corrupt without the complete ending sentence.

##Question 6
####Level
7/10
####Suggestion
* do not have fluquent process.
