#April 2nd, TPO4 review

###Practice_Question1
* The first sentence has I guess has some mis-pronounce. You are saying like **Dumpling is the thing that I ... when I am away**, didn't catch the idea here.

* (0:06) you can say `Because dumpling represents a feeling of reunion with families`

* (0:14) `In every festival`, not **each**

* (0:14) `My parents will prepare festival dinner, and dumpling is one of the most important dishes`, **feeding foods**, as you used, sounds very strange.

* (0:25) `We chat with each other, talking many interesting stories`, **communicate** is not usually used in daily.

* (0:40) `dumplings contain meat and vegetable inside`, I google how to describe dumplings, you could say `dumplings look like a small ball, which contain meat and vegetable inside and a piece of dough outside`

###Practice_Question2
This paragraph sounds good and clear!
* (0:20) `In order to catch up the lecture on time`

###Practice_Question3
* beginning, `the girl votes for ` or `the girl agrees with`.

* the girl thinks night-class is cost-effective, but boy thinks it is expensive. May be you need also say the reason why the girl thought it is cost-effective.

* (0:45) `hire teaches to open classes at night`, not **apply**

* (0:55) didn't understand the last sentence you said, `because computers are durable`, after this word, I am confused about the meaning.

###Practice_Question4
* (0:30) `he gives his uncle a big smile standing for I feel really happy about your coming`

* (0:50) `he hurts himself by hammer in accident`

* not a good ending, I know you are trying to say the professor shows smile to his daughter as well. but represents different meaning. You can emphasize two different smiles, without too much description for situation. Trying to simplify the description like this: `In another situation that the professor hurt himself by hammer accidently, he also shows smile to his daughter which means: I am fine, don't worry`

###Practice_Question5
* (0:30) `the hall is far away, he has to run to have the class on time`

* (0:55) `where is the psychology class`, didn't say `where`.

* I remember this type of question that asking your opinion, maybe we need give more time to say our own opinion. Please check the answer.

###Practice_Question6
* this one is good and fluent, maybe I forget some color description words. except I don't understand `junger color`, `coming color `

* (0:15) 'specific', wrong pronunciation. please check.

* except, I forgot some description words, I can totally understand the meaning. good work.
